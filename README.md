# Implementation-of-CDMA-Transmitter-and-Receiver-using-Intel-DE2i-150-FPGA-board
Using the Quartus II software, an OFDM transmitter system was designed and implemented on Intel DE2i-150 board. Here QPSK is used as the digital modulation technique and Altera FFT MegaCore Function has been used to implement the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform block. The output of the OFDM transmitter is displayed on the monitor by implementing VGA Controller.
